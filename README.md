# Micro-Frontend Demos

## First project: a simple demo showcasing a container (host) and two remote files (cart, product)

- Uses Webpack and its [Module Federation Plugin](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) to separate the micro-projects into individual, isolated projects.
- Check it out in the [basic_app](./basic_app) directory.

## Second project: A SaaS Demo app that utilises Frontend Frameworks in conjunction with micro-frontends.

- Inside the [landing_page_demo](./landing_page_demo) directory.
